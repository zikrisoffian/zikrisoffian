- 👋 Hi, I’m @zikrisoffian. I love to apply statistical knowledge and machine learning model to interesting dataset that I found. I also enjoy reading books for both non-fiction and fiction and I love watching movies.
    My favorite fiction book is Kokoro by Natsumei Soseki and my favorite movies is Forest Gump.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, data analysis and machine learning.
    I have learnt and practice statistical knowledge when I was in engineering school, such as A/B testing and regression analysis.
     I study data analysis on daily basis, using python (Jupyter Notebook), mostly using dataset from Kaggle.
     So far I have learn basic of machine learning model such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, logistic regression etc.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning time-series analysis using ARIMA.
     The basic of ARIMA is not so difficult (for me) but parameteres tuning sure is challenging.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis particularly using large dataset.
     I would love to contribute my skills for communities of data analysis learners. My tools, though still immature include Python, Java, SQL, and Power BI.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My research about rainfall distribution in Malaysia nudge me to learn data analysis.
