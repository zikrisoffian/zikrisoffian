- 👋 Hi, I’m @zikrisoffian. I love to apply statistical knowledge and machine learning models to interesting datasets that I find on Kaggle or anywhere else.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.
I learned and practiced statistical knowledge when I was in engineering school, such as A/B testing and regression analysis.
I study data analysis on a daily basis using Python (Jupyter Notebook), mostly using datasets from Kaggle.
So far, I have learned the basics of machine learning models such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression, etc.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning time-series analysis using ARIMA.
     The basic of ARIMA is not so difficult (for me) but parameteres tuning sure is challenging.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis, particularly using large datasets.
I would love to contribute my skills to communities of data analysis learners.
     
- 📫 Feel free to reach me though X @zikrisoffian
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: My research about rainfall distribution in Malaysia nudges me to learn data analysis. I enjoy reading books for both non-fiction and fiction, and I love watching movies.
My favorite fiction book is Kokoro by Natsumei Soseki, and my favorite movie is Forest Gump.
